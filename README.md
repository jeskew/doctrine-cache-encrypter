Having to encrypt your data at rest shouldn't keep you from using the open-source
tools you know and love. If you have data that needs a higher degree of security
than the rest of your cache, you can store and access it via an 
`EncryptingCacheDecorator`.

## Caveats

Encryption and decryption are both expensive operations, and frequent reads from
an encrypted data store can quickly become a bottleneck in otherwise performant
applications. Use encrypted caches sparingly (i.e., **do not** use an encrypting
decorator around your Doctrine Annotations cache).

## Usage

> This package provides two cache decorators, one that encrypts data using
a pass phrase and one that does so with public and private keys. The
implementation using a pass phrase is the more performant of the two but
requires that you securely deploy a plaintext password.

First, create your Doctrine-based cache as you normally would:
```php
$cache = new \Doctrine\Common\Cache\RedisCache($redisClient);
```

Second, wrap your cache with an encrypting decorator:
```php
$encryptedCache = new \Jsq\Cache\PasswordEncryption\Decorator(
    $cache,
    $password,
    $cipher // optional, defaults to 'aes-256-cbc'
);
```

Then use your `$cache` and `$encryptedCache` like you normally would:
```php
$cache->save('normal_cache_data', 'Totally normal!');

$encryptedCache->save('api_keys', $keys);
```

Though your regular cache and encrypted cache share a storage layer and a
keyspace, they will not be able to read each other's data. The `$encryptedCache`
will return `false` if asked to read unencrypted data, and the regular `$cache`
will return gibberish if asked to read encrypted data.

## Encrypting your cache without sharing secrets

If you'd rather not rely on a shared password, the `EnvelopeEncryption\Decorator`
can secure your sensitive cache entries using a public/private key pair. 

```php
$encryptedCache = new \Jsq\Cache\EnvelopeEncryption\Decorator(
    $cache,
    'file:///path/to/certificate.pem',
    'file:///path/to/private/key.pem',
    $passphrase_for_private_key_file, // optional, defaults to null
    $cipher // optional, defaults to 'aes-256-cbc'
);
```

> The certificate can be a valid x509 certificate, a path to a PEM-encoded
certificate file (the path must be prefaced with `file://`), or a PEM-encoded
certificate string. The private key can be a path to a PEM-encoded private key
file (the path must be prefaced with `file://`), or a PEM-encoded certificate string.
